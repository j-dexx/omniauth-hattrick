# Omniauth::Hattrick

[Hattrick](https://www.hattrick.org) CHPP OmniAuth Strategy

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-hattrick'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-hattrick

## Usage

Tell OmniAuth about this provider.

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :hattrick, ENV['HATTRICK_KEY'], ENV['HATTRICK_SECRET']
    end

`"HATTRICK_KEY"` and `"HATTRICK_SECRET"` should be your CHPP product's consumer key and consumer secret

Next configure your routes

    get 'auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'Â·

## Hash returned

At the moment all that is returned is the token, token secret, user id and username as that is all I think we need.
